# Week 4 Assignment

This project contains solutions to various JavaScript programming tasks for Week 4 of the CareerEX program. The tasks include implementing functions for grading, eligibility checks, and other logical operations. The project also includes an HTML file to link the JavaScript code for testing in a browser.

## Project Structure

- **`gg.html`**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the project. It includes a `<script>` tag to load the JavaScript file.
- **`index.js`**: The JavaScript file containing all the solutions to the assignment tasks.

## How to Use

1. Open the gg.html file in a web browser.
2. The JavaScript code in index.js will execute, prompting the user for input and displaying results in the browser's console.

## Tasks Implemented

1. **Check Score**:
   - A function that takes a student's score and logs "Passed" if it's 180 or above, otherwise logs "Failed".

2. **Voting Eligibility**:
   - A function that checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age.

3. **Grade Student**:
   - A function that takes a student's name and score and returns their grade (Excellent, Good, Average, or Fail).

4. **Switch Grader**:
   - A function that uses a `switch` statement to determine a student's grade based on their score.

5. **Access Check**:
   - A function that checks if a user has an ID and is above 18 to grant access.

6. **Array Score Check**:
   - A loop that iterates through an array of scores and logs "Pass" or "Fail" for each score.

7. **Subject Pass Check**:
   - An arrow function that checks if a student passed both Math and English.

8. **Signup Validator**:
   - A function that ensures a user provides either an email or phone number before signing up.

## How to Test

1. Open the browser's developer tools (usually accessible via `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Navigate to the "Console" tab.
3. Follow the prompts displayed in the console to test each function.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- JavaScript enabled in the browser.

## Notes

- Ensure the index.js file is in the same directory as gg.html for the `<script>` tag to work correctly.
- Input validation is implemented in most functions to handle invalid or empty inputs gracefully.
